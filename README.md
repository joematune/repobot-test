    A Typescript SPA using React and Apollo Client on the front end & an Apollo server that wraps an <a href="https://api.chucknorris.io/" title="Chuck Norris API">existing REST API</a> with a GraphQL API. This project was completed as a Fullstack Engineer Test - it was quite involved and quite a bit of fun :)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can follow these steps to run the project locally or <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/zealous-nightingale-qwcvd?file=/src/index.tsx">view it live now!</a>

### Prerequisites

npm and Node are required for running the project on your machine. Install the latest version of npm.
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```
Check for your version of Node. Find the LTS at <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/</a>.
```sh
node --version
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into the directory
```sh
git clone https://github.com/joematune/repobot-test
cd repobot-test
```
2. Install both client and server packages with the following two commands.
```sh
npm install
npm --prefix ./server install ./server
```
3. Run both the client and server. NOTE: Don't run `npm start` as it won't start your API server
```sh
npm run dev
```
