    A Typescript SPA using React and Apollo Client on the front end & an Apollo server that wraps an <a href="https://api.chucknorris.io/" title="Chuck Norris API">existing REST API</a> with a GraphQL API. This project was completed as a Fullstack Engineer Test - it was quite involved and quite a bit of fun :)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can follow these steps to run the project locally or <a href="https://github.com /othneildrew/Best-README-Template">view it live now!</a>

### Prerequisites

npm and Node.js are required for running the project on your machine. Install the latest version of npm.
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into the directory
```sh
git clone https://github.com/joematune/repobot-test
cd repobot-test
```
2. Install both client and server packages with the following two commands.
```sh
npm install
npm --prefix ./server install ./server
```
3. Run both the client and server. NOTE: Don't run `npm start` as it won't start your API server
```sh
npm run dev
```


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
